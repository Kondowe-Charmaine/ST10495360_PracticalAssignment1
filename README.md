The applications that l created use basic object-oriented programming ideas like classes, objects, inheritance, and methods that work differently in different classes.Data is kept safe using private fields with getters and setters. Lists and loops are used to handle multiple clients, workouts, and series, while if-else statements help control the flow, check user input, and manage rules like towel distribution. The menu lets users choose what to do, and the program calculates totals and generates reports, keeping things organized and easy to use.
